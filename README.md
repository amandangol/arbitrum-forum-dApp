# Forum dApp

In this quest, we have built a decentralized application (dApp) that serves as a Forum, enabling users to create posts, add comments, conduct polls, and engage with content through likes and votes. This smart contract is designed to manage the core functionalities of a forum, ensuring seamless interactions between posts, comments, polls, and user engagement.

## Smart Contract Overview

The smart contract at the core of this dApp is responsible for managing the following:

- **Posts**: Users can create posts, edit them, and interact with posts created by other users.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on posts, reply to comments, and engage in discussions.
- **Polls**: Users can create and participate in polls, selecting from multiple options.
- **Engagement**: Users can upvote or downvote posts and comments to show their preference or agreement.

## Frontend Development

Now, for the section of building the frontend that interacts with the smart contract. The frontend will allow users to create and engage with content on the forum, leveraging the decentralized features of the blockchain.

## UI Components

The following UI components will be created to support the functionality of the Forum dApp:

1. **Create Post Component**: A user-friendly form that allows users to create new posts.
2. **Create Poll Component**: A form for users to initiate polls with customizable options.
3. **Create Comment Component**: A comment box that allows users to add comments to posts.
4. **Upvote/Downvote Component**: Buttons that allow users to upvote or downvote posts or comments.
5. **Post and Comment Listing Component**: A listing page that displays user posts and comments, with pagination for easy browsing.

## Interactivity

The UI will provide users with the ability to:

- **Create and manage posts**: Users can create new posts or manage existing ones.
- **Engage with posts and comments**: Users can upvote or downvote posts and comments, contributing to community discussions.
- **Create and participate in polls**: Users can conduct polls, view the results, and participate in polls created by others.
- **Navigate through user posts and comments**: The interface will include pagination for easier navigation through posts and comments.
